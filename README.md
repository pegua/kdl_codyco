# Deprecated repository

All code migrated to the [iDynTree library](https://github.com/robotology/idyntree). In particular the "undirected tree" data structure present in this repository has been re-implemented as `iDynTree::Model` in the `Core` component of iDynTree, and the KDL-based algorithm once presend in `kdl_codyco` has been moved to the `KDL` component of iDynTree.
